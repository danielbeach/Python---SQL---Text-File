# Python---SQL---Text-File
The point of this code is to show who to write data from a SQL table to a text file
using Python. It uses pyodbc. There is a slow version and a fast version.
This is to show the difference between fetchall() and fetchmany().

You will need a blank text file called results.txt, also running the SQL file
on your RDBMS of choice.
